<p>In this book we&rsquo;re going to work through the start-to-finish build of an application called <em>Greenlight</em> &mdash; a JSON API for retrieving and managing information about movies. You can think of the core functionality as being a bit like the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">Open Movie Database API</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our <em>Greenlight</em> API will support the following endpoints and actions:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>URL Pattern</th>
<th>Action</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>GET</td>
<td>/v1/healthcheck</td>
<td>Show application health and version information</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GET</td>
<td>/v1/movies</td>
<td>Show the details of all movies</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>POST</td>
<td>/v1/movies</td>
<td>Create a new movie</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GET</td>
<td>/v1/movies/:id</td>
<td>Show the details of a specific movie</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PATCH</td>
<td>/v1/movies/:id</td>
<td>Update the details of a specific movie</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>DELETE</td>
<td>/v1/movies/:id</td>
<td>Delete a specific movie</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>POST</td>
<td>/v1/users</td>
<td>Register a new user</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PUT</td>
<td>/v1/users/activated</td>
<td>Activate a specific user</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>PUT</td>
<td>/v1/users/password</td>
<td>Update the password for a specific user</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>POST</td>
<td>/v1/tokens/authentication</td>
<td>Generate a new authentication token</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>POST</td>
<td>/v1/tokens/password-reset</td>
<td>Generate a new password-reset token</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GET</td>
<td>/debug/vars</td>
<td>Display application metrics</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To give you an idea of what the API will look like from a client&rsquo;s point of view, by the end of this book the <code>GET /v1/movies/:id</code> endpoint will return a HTTP response with a JSON body similar to this:</p>

<figure class="code bash">
<pre>$ curl -H &#34;Authorization: Bearer RIDBIAE3AMMK57T6IAEBUGA7ZQ&#34; localhost:4000/v1/movies/1
<samp>{
    &#34;movie&#34;: {
        &#34;id&#34;: 1,
        &#34;title&#34;: &#34;Moana&#34;,
        &#34;year&#34;: 2016,
        &#34;runtime&#34;: &#34;107 mins&#34;,
        &#34;genres&#34;: [
            &#34;animation&#34;,
            &#34;adventure&#34;
        ],
        &#34;version&#34;: 1
    }
}</samp></pre>
</figure>

<p>Behind the scenes, we&rsquo;ll use PostgreSQL as the database to persistently store all the data. And at the end of the book, we&rsquo;ll deploy the finished API to a Linux server running on DigitalOcean.</p>

<aside class="important"><p>
<strong>Important:</strong> The Go 1.25 release ships with <em>experimental</em> support for a new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json/v2@master"><code>encoding/json/v2</code></a> package, which can be enabled by setting the environment variable <code>GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2</code> at build time.</p>

<p>This new package brings some <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json@go1.25.0#hdr-Migrating_to_v2">nice improvements</a> to working with JSON in Go, but because it is still experimental, the behavior and design of the package is still being evaluated and remains subject to change. For that reason, in this book we will use the stable <code>encoding/json</code> package (which will remain &ldquo;forever supported&rdquo; due to the Go compatibility promise).</p>

<p>Once <code>encoding/json/v2</code> is no longer experimental, and has graduated to general availability in the standard library, I&rsquo;ll update this book to use it.

<h3 id="conventions">Conventions</h3>

<p>Code blocks in this book are shown with a silver background, like the example below. If a code block is particularly long, any parts that aren&rsquo;t relevant may be replaced with an ellipsis. To make it easy to follow along, most code blocks also have a title bar at the top indicating the name of the file containing the code. Like this:</p>

<figure class="code go">
<figcaption>File: hello.go</figcaption>
<pre><span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nx">main</span>

<span class="o">...</span> <span class="c1">// Indicates that some existing code has been omitted.
</span><span class="c1"></span>
<span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">sayHello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#34;Hello world!&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></pre>
</figure>

<p>Terminal (command line) instructions are shown with a black background and generally start with a dollar symbol. These commands should work on any Unix-based operating system, including macOS and Linux. Sample output is shown in silver beneath the command, like so:</p>

<figure class="code bash">
<pre>$ echo &#34;Hello world!&#34;
<samp>Hello world!</samp></pre>
</figure>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using Windows, you should replace these with the command prompt equivalent or carry out the action via the normal Windows GUI.</p>

<p>Please note that the dates and timestamps shown in screenshots and the example output from commands are illustrative only. They do not necessarily align with each other, or progress chronologically throughout the book.</p>

<p>Some chapters in this book end with an <em>additional information</em> section. These sections contain information that isn&rsquo;t relevant to our application build, but is still important (or sometimes, just interesting) to know about.</p>

<aside class="hint"><p>
<strong>Hint:</strong> If you&rsquo;re following along with the application build I recommend using the HTML version of this book, instead of the PDF or EPUB. The HTML version works in all browsers, and the proper formatting of code blocks is retained if you want to copy-and-paste code directly from the book. When using the HTML version, you can also use the left and right arrow keys to navigate between chapters.
