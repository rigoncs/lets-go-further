<p>In this final section of the book we&rsquo;ll look at how to deploy our API application to a production server and expose it on the internet.</p>

<p>Every project and project team will have different technical and business needs in terms of hosting and deployment, so it&rsquo;s impossible to lay out a one-size-fits-all approach here.</p>

<p>To make the content in this section as widely applicable and portable as possible, we&rsquo;ll focus on hosting the application on a self-managed Linux server (something provided by a myriad of hosting companies worldwide) and using standard Linux tooling to manage server configuration and deployment.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll also be automating the server configuration and deployment process as much as possible, so that it&rsquo;s easy to make <em>continuous deployments</em> and possible to <em>replicate the server</em> in the future if you need to.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re planning to follow along, we&rsquo;ll be using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> as the hosting provider in this book. DigitalOcean isn&rsquo;t free, but it&rsquo;s good value and the cost of running a server starts at $4 USD per month. If you don&rsquo;t want to use DigitalOcean, you should be able to follow basically the same approach we outline here with any other Linux hosting provider.</p>

<p>In terms of infrastructure and architecture, we&rsquo;ll run everything on a single Ubuntu Linux server. Our stack will consist of a PostgreSQL database and the executable binary for our Greenlight API, operating in much the same way that we&rsquo;ve seen so far in this book. But in addition to this, we&rsquo;ll also run <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> as a <em>reverse proxy</em> in front of the Greenlight API.</p>

<p>Using Caddy has a couple of benefits. It will automatically handle and terminate HTTPS connections for us &mdash; including automatically generating and managing TLS certificates via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a> and <a href="https://zerossl.com/">ZeroSSL</a> &mdash; and we can also use Caddy to easily restrict internet access to our metrics endpoint.</p>

<p>In this section you&rsquo;ll learn how to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Commission an Ubuntu Linux server running on DigitalOcean to host your application.</p></li>

<li><p>Automate the configuration of the server &mdash; including creating user accounts, configuring the firewall and installing necessary software.</p></li>

<li><p>Automate the process of updating your application and deploying changes to the server.</p></li>

<li><p>How to run your application as a background service using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a>, as a non-root user.</p></li>

<li><p>Use Caddy as a reverse proxy in front of your application to automatically manage TLS certificates and handle HTTPS connections.</p></li>
</ul>
